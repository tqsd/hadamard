# hadamard
This code calculates the performance of a Hadamard receiver [1] when used as optical pre-processor in a receiver at very high baud-rates. The deviation between conventional- and quantum signal processing gets large when the baud-rates increase [2]. Moreover, baud-rates are increasing historically [3]. 
In this code, you can change the baud-rate, transmission energy, length of the Hadamard sequences and also fiber length. The code considers phase noise resulting from the Kerr effect [4]. The code was used for the publication [5].
